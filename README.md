# Introduction 
This's a small project which shows you how I manage a project's structure, the app's architect(MVVM) combine with some design patterns. 
Moreover, you'll see SOLID principle is applied throught the project.

# Getting Started
* Checkout the "main" branch for demonstration purpose
* In the first time you open this project please wait until Swift Package Manger is finished its job.
* You should test this project on an actual device for the best experience.
* This app has three tabs, the first tab is for random videos from https://pexels.com , the second one is weather tab from https://openweathermap.org/ and the last tab is for demostration about SwiftUI.
* This demo need API keys of both Pexel & OpenWeatherMap services, you can request one here https://www.pexels.com/api/new and https://openweathermap.org/api

*** The project also contains an extension of notification so you'll need a paid account to create a provisioning for testing Remote Push Notification.

The weather feature will get today's information about Ho Chi Minh city(my hometown of course!), but it's will update all the day from around 01:30
to 22:30, so if you test this app before 01:30 you may get nothing.
