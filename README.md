# Introduction 
This's a small project which shows you how I manage a project's structure, the app's architect(MVVM) combine with some design patterns. 
Moreover, you'll see SOLID principle is applied throught the project.

# Getting Started
* Checkout the "main" branch for demonstration purpose
* In the first time you open this project please wait until Swift Package Manger is finished its job.
* You should test this project on an actual device for the best experience.
* This app has three tabs, the first tab is for random videos from https://pexels.com , the second one is weather tab from https://www.metaweather.com and the last tab is for demostration about SwiftUI.
* This demo need a API key of Pexel, you can request one here https://www.pexels.com/api/new/

The weather feature will get today's information about Ho Chi Minh city(my hometown of course!), but it's will update all the day from around 01:30
to 22:30, so if you test this app before 01:30 you may get nothing.
