# Introduction 
This's a small project which shows you how I manage a project's structure, the app's architect(MVVM) combine with some design patterns. 
Moreover, you'll see SOLID principle is applied throught the project.

# Getting Started
* Checkout the "main" branch for demonstration purpose
* In the first time you open this project please wait until Swift Package Manger is finished its job.
* You should test this project on an actual device for the best experience.
* This app has three tabs, the first tab is for random videos from https://pexels.com , the second one is weather tab from https://openweathermap.org/ and the last tab is for demostration about SwiftUI.
* This demo need API keys of both Pexel & OpenWeatherMap services, you can request one here https://www.pexels.com/api/new and https://openweathermap.org/api

*** The project also contains an extension of notification so you'll need a paid account to create a provisioning for testing Remote Push Notification.  
In case you don't have a paid account, please check out branch named "**without-push-notification**" instead.

The weather feature will get today's information about Ho Chi Minh city(my hometown of course!), but it's will update all the day from around 01:30
to 22:30, so if you test this app before 01:30 you may get nothing.
