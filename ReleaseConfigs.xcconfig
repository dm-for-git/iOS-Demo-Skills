// !!! NOTICE !!!
// You may wonder why didn't I put all secret keys into Info.plist file?
// That's because if someone got your ipa file and exact it
// then the Info.plist file content can be read directly
// without any encryption, but in the other spectrum all code
// files and string files are encrypted by default


// For testing only, NEVER put production token here, you MUST encrypt your token
// You can request one here https://www.pexels.com/api/
PEXEL_TOKEN = 
// You can request one here https://openweathermap.org/api
